# FCOS core
Note that `fcos_core` corresponds to `maskrcnn_benchmark` in the original `maskrcnn_benchmark` repository. \
We changed the name to avoid conflicts with the original maskrcnn-benchmark installation.

The core code of FCOS detector is located under [modeling/rpn/fcos][modeling/rpn/fcos] .
